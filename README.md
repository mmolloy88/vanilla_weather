# vanilla weather

a small module made with vanilla JS, showing off several different JS components:

- a clock in the header that should return the users local time
- a weather searcher, which will show the temperature in the city searched for
- a theme selector in the footer of the module which changes the background colour and text colour for accessibilty.

#### credits:

I followed a guide on _[dev.to](https://dev.to/ahmadullahnikzad/how-to-create-digital-clock-in-vanilla-js-2172)_ for the clock module.

The weather and theme modules were learned through _[General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)_
